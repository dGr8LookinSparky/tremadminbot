TremAdminBot: A bot that provides some helper functions for Tremulous server 
administration

This bot handles functions useful to tremulous admins that would not be 
practical to do within game itself, such as asynchronous database and dns 
lookups.

It is written in perl and intended to run on the same server as the game 
server, watching games.log, and acting/responding when appropriate.

Check out the source with:
git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/tremadminbot.git

------ FEATURES ------
* Keeps track of server users, the countries where they connect from, their
  aliases (by GUID), and the history of admin actions against them
* Stores info in an sqlite3 database, easily searchable by the server owner
* Provides commands to admins that are either inappropriate or impossible
  to implement within Tremulous itself

------ COMMANDS ------
* seen <name>
  - Input a name or partial name of a user to find out when they last
    connected, and the total number of times the name has been used.
  - Aliases are not resolved. If a player connects as "name1" and then
    connects as "name2" under the same guid, searching for "name1" will
    only show the last time he used "name1"
* memo <command> [arguments]
  - Replicates an IRC-style memoserv to send memos to offline players.
    Players with new memos are notified when they connect.
  - memo list: lists your memos available
  - memo read <memoID>: read a particular memo from another user
  - memo send <username> <text>: send a memo to a user. Only users who have
    connected (under the same guid, under any name) in the past 3 months can
    be targetted.
  - memo outbox: list memos you sent and whether or not they were receieved
  - memo unsend <memoID>: undo sending a particular memo
  - memo clear <ALL|READ>: clear all your memos, or all of your read memos
* geoip <name|slot#|IP>
  - Print the reverse DNS and city/region/country a user is connecting from
  - User must be connected currently, or else you can specify an IP address
    directly.
* l1 <name|slot#>
  - Set a user who is currently admin level 0 to admin level 1
  - User must be currently connected
* aliases <name|slot#>
  - See the aliases of a user who is currently connected
  - Aliases are resolved by GUID
* rapsheet <name|slot#> [GUID|IP|SUBNET]
  - Lists the numbers of kicks/bans/mutes/denybuilds on a player
  - Specify how to search:
    + GUID: actions against players with this GUID (default)
    + IP: actions against players with this IP address. Because player IP
      addresses can change, this may have actions from other physically nearby
      people or not list all actions.
    + SUBNET: actions against players with this subnet. Subnets are always /24
      (xxx.xxx.xxx.*). See above note for IP mode.

------ REQUIREMENTS ------
* Own a tremulous gameserver where you can run this perl script 24/7 alongside it
* Tremulous server should be running GPP, with the latest release. I do not
  intend to write support for old logfile formats.
* Some form of database engine. This was written for and tested on sqlite3
* The following perl modules installed from CPAN:
  - DBI
  - Data::Dumper
  - Geo::IP::PurePerl;
  - Text::ParseWords;
  - Socket
  - Socket6
  - enum
  - FileHandle
  - File::ReadBackwards;
* GeoIP database files (http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/)
* You have three choices for the bot to interact with the server, with
  differing requirements:
  - COM_PIPEFILE: Recommended and best option. LINUX ONLY. Requires tremded
    binary be compiled after r2208, or you otherwise apply the patch to an
    earlier version:
    http://lakitu.mercenariesguild.net/temp/com_pipefile2.patch
  - RCON: Rcon must be enabled on the server, and you must provide the address
    and password. Usage appears in the server logs as regular rcon usage.
  - SCREEN: This uses some hacks to send the commands to the screen session.
    It works okay but it mostly sucks. If you have real people who attach to
    the screen session and interact with the server that way, this will suck
    bigtime as the two will interfere with each other.
* Usage requirements for memory/cpu should be very minimal, except when you are
  running in BACKLOG mode, one-time parsing old logfiles (optional).

------ INSTALL ------
* If you meet all the requirements above, download the script:
  git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/tremadminbot.git
* Trem server configuration:
  - Set g_logfilesync 1
  - If using com_pipefile communication, set com_pipefile
    I recommend setting it to ".tremded_pipe" and then it will show up in
    fs_homepath/fs_game/.tremded_pipe
  - Add and configure the appropriate commands in admin.dat. See admin.dat
    section below
* Bot Configuration: Create a file named config.cfg. Add any variables to it
  that you need to change from the default settings. Configuration variables
  and their defaults are listed/documented at the beginning of the main source
  file (tremAdminBot.pl)
* Run it inside screen or whatever. Set the script executable. There are no
  commandline parameters currently.
* You may want to use the BACKLOG option (see configuration) to collect data
  from appropripately-formatted logfiles from before you began to run the bot

------ admin.dat ------
* Add the following to your admin.dat to make tremded aware of the commands
* Add the appropriate flags to various admins/levels to allow them to use them
* If you do not want to use some command, remove its command entry.

[command]
command = seen
exec = 
desc = When was a user last seen?
flag = seen

[command]
command = memo
exec = 
desc = Send and receive memos to players.
flag = memo

[command]
command = geoip
exec = 
desc = Look up a user's country etc.
flag = geoip

[command]
command = l1
exec = 
desc = Set a level 0 user to level 1
flag = l1

[command]
command = aliases
exec = 
desc = See a user's aliases.
flag = aliases

[command]
command = rapsheet
exec = 
desc = See a user's history of bans/mutes etc.
flag = rapsheet

------ CONTACT ------
Support for this project is limited: it assumes a high level of technical
competence, and the requirements are such that few people will really be able
to run it. If you do not understand most of what I am talking about, this is
probably not for you, sorry.
